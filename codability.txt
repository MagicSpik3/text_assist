To clarify the terminology:

    Section: The highest level (e.g., C - Manufacturing).

    Division (2-digit): The main categories within a Section.

    Group (3-digit): The "children" of a Division.

    Class (4-digit): The "grandchildren" of a Division.

    Sub-class (5-digit): The final, most detailed "leaves" of the hierarchy.

Section C: Manufacturing

This is by far the largest and most detailed section in the entire SIC classification system. Its complexity reflects the vast diversity of products and industrial processes.

    Divisions (2-digit): 24

        It spans from Division 10 (Manufacture of food products) through to Division 33 (Repair and installation of machinery and equipment).

    Groups (3-digit children): 99

    Classes (4-digit grandchildren): 234

    Sub-classes (5-digit leaves): 304

Section P: Education

This section is much simpler and more focused. Its structure is based on the level of education provided rather than a wide variety of outputs.

    Divisions (2-digit): 1

        It consists solely of Division 85 (Education).

    Groups (3-digit children): 6

    Classes (4-digit grandchildren): 10

    Sub-classes (5-digit leaves): 12
