Of course. This is a classic and very common point of frustration when working with plotting libraries in specific environments like a Linux VM. You have done all the right things, but there is one crucial, non-obvious step missing.

Let's walk through what's happening and how to fix it robustly.

### The Core Problem: Matplotlib's Font Cache

The error message `findfont: ... not found` is the key. It tells you that even though you installed Arial on your system with `apt`, **Matplotlib does not know it exists.**

This is because Matplotlib maintains its own **font cache** for performance reasons. When you first import it, it scans your system for fonts and creates a list. It will not automatically re-scan for new fonts on subsequent imports. You have installed a new font, but you are still using the old, outdated cache.

The solution is to **force Matplotlib to delete its old cache and rebuild it**, thereby discovering the newly installed Arial font.

### Step-by-Step Solution

Here is a reliable process to solve this. I recommend running these commands in a terminal within your VM, not inside the notebook itself.

#### Step 1: Verify Arial is Installed on the System

First, let's confirm that the `apt` command worked correctly. Run this in your Linux terminal:

```bash
fc-list | grep -i "arial.ttf"
```

You should see output that lists file paths, like `/usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts/Arial.ttf`. If you see this, the font is on your system. If this command returns nothing, the font installation failed, and you should try running `sudo apt install --reinstall ttf-mscorefonts-installer`.

#### Step 2: Find and Delete Matplotlib's Font Cache

Now, we need to find and delete the outdated cache file.

1.  **Find the Cache Directory:** Run this small Python command in your terminal. Make sure you activate your Poetry environment first (`poetry shell`).

    ```bash
    python -c "import matplotlib; print(matplotlib.get_cachedir())"
    ```

    This will print a path, for example: `/home/user/.cache/matplotlib`

2.  **Delete the Font Cache File:** Navigate to that directory and delete the `fontlist-vXXX.json` file.

    ```bash
    # Using the example path from above
    rm /home/user/.cache/matplotlib/fontlist-*.json
    ```

    Don't worry, this is perfectly safe. Matplotlib will automatically regenerate this file the next time it's needed.

#### Step 3: Restart the Jupyter Kernel (Crucial Step)

This is non-negotiable. The Python process running your notebook must be completely stopped and restarted.

  * In VS Code, click the **"Restart Kernel"** icon (the circular arrow) in the notebook's toolbar.

When you run a cell that imports `matplotlib` or `seaborn` for the first time after this restart, it will not find its cache file. It will be forced to rescan your system's font directories, discover Arial, and build a new, correct `fontlist.json`. This process might make your first plot take a few seconds longer to generate, which is normal.

### Best Practice: A Reusable Styling Function

Now that the font is fixed, let's address your goal of standardizing all your graphs. The best way to do this is to create a single helper function that sets all your desired styles. This ensures every graph in your project looks identical.

Here is an example you can put at the top of your notebooks. It includes the official GSS colour palette you asked about previously.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

def set_gss_style(font_scale: float = 1.2):
    """
    Applies a standardized style to all subsequent plots, using the
    GSS colour palette and Arial font.

    Args:
        font_scale (float): Multiplier for font sizes.
    """
    # 1. Define the official GSS colour palette
    gss_palette = [
        "#12436D",  # Main Blue
        "#28A197",  # Main Teal
        "#801650",  # Main Magenta
        "#F46A25",  # Main Orange
        "#3D3D3D",  # Dark Grey
        "#A285D1",  # Supporting Purple
    ]
    sns.set_palette(gss_palette)

    # 2. Set the context and font scale
    sns.set_context("paper", font_scale=font_scale)

    # 3. Set the font family to Arial
    # This will now work because the cache has been rebuilt.
    plt.rcParams["font.family"] = "sans-serif"
    plt.rcParams["font.sans-serif"] = "Arial"
    
    # Optional: Set other global parameters
    plt.rcParams["axes.spines.top"] = False
    plt.rcParams["axes.spines.right"] = False
    plt.rcParams["figure.dpi"] = 100
    
    print("GSS plot style applied.")


# --- Example Usage in your Notebook ---

# Call this function once at the top of your notebook
set_gss_style()

# Now, any plot you create will automatically use the correct style
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
data_to_plot = [10, 25, 18, 32, 15]
sns.barplot(x=["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"], y=data_to_plot)
plt.title("Example Plot with GSS Styling", fontsize=16)
plt.ylabel("Value")
plt.show()

```

This approach solves your immediate technical problem and provides a robust, professional framework for standardizing all your future visualisations.
